# Data Analyst Portfolio by Joann Coronado

This portfolio contains exercises and projects in topics relating to data analytics. I will continue to add more sections, projects and exercises as I learn more about the subject.

## Web Scraping
[Spotify Tracks](https://github.com/jcoronado4/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Web%20Scraping/spotify_tracks.py): This code is an exercise based on the video tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI "Intro to Web Scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup"). It uses web scraping to extract the title, artist and album of the first 
30 songs from the "Today's Top Hits" playlist on spotify. This information is then written to a CSV file entitled "spotify_tracks.csv".

## Future Topics:
### APIs
### SQL Project
### Machine Learning Techniques
