# Data Analyst Portfolio by Joann Coronado

This portfolio contains exercises and projects in topics relating to data analytics. I will continue to add more sections, projects and exercises as I learn more about the subject.

## Web Scraping
[Spotify Tracks](https://github.com/jcoronado4/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Web%20Scraping/spotify_tracks.py): This code is an exercise based on the video tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI "Intro to Web Scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup"). It uses web scraping to extract the title, artist and album of the first 
30 songs from the "Today's Top Hits" playlist on spotify. This information is then written to a CSV file entitled "spotify_tracks.csv".

## APIs

[Spotify Playlists Tracks](https://github.com/jcoronado4/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/APIs/spotify_playlists_tracks.py): This code uses the Spotify API and Spotipy library to create a CSV file for each of my chosen playlists. Each CSV contains information for every track in the playlist along with the date the track was added to the file. When rerun it appends any new tracks to the CSV. A new folder and files are created each year.

[Spotify Genre Sorter](https://github.com/jcoronado4/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/APIs/spotify_genre_sorter.py): This code uses the Spotify API and Spotipy library to take in a spotify playlist URI as an input and sorts the tracks of the playlist by decade into new saved playlists.

[Extract Billboard Tracks](https://github.com/jcoronado4/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/APIs/extract_billboard_tracks.py): This code uses the billboard.py API to extract information from a given billboard chart in a given time frame. It creates a folder and file for each year in the time frame and outputs CSV files containing the track title and artist.
